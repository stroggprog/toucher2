# toucher2

toucher Plugin for DokuWiki

touches config files

Original code was taken from `toucher` by Andriy Nych
A long outstanding bug was corrected, and then the code was hacked and beaten until it did what I wanted it to do, which was generally not what Andriy had set out to do.

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:toucher2

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/toucher2/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
